This project used the data set from:
https://github.com/ml4py/dataset-iiit-pet.git

ImageHandling/image_organization_script.py processes this data and separates it into 2 folders:
ImageHandling/images/canines
ImageHandling/images/felines

That way, ImageHandling/image_labels.csv is created by ImageHandling/dataframe_creation.py
